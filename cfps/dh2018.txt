I: GENERAL INFORMATION

The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) invites submission of proposals for its annual conference on any aspect of digital humanities. The theme of the 2018 conference is “Bridges/Puentes,” and contributions that speak to the theme or that focus on knowledge mobilization, collaboration among scholars and scholarly communities, relationships of North/South scholarship and epistemologies, globalization and digital divides, public-facing and community-engaged scholarship, translation, digital ecologies, hacker culture, and digital indigenous studies are especially encouraged. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

    Humanities research enabled through digital media, artificial intelligence or machine learning, software studies, mapping and geographic information systems, or information design and modeling;
    Social, institutional, global, gender, multilingual, and multicultural aspects of digital humanities including digital feminisms, digital indigenous studies, digital cultural and ethnic studies, digital black studies, digital queer studies;
    Theoretical, epistemological, historical, or related aspects and interpretations of digital humanities practice and theory;
    Computer applications in literary, linguistic, cultural, archaeological, and historical studies, including public humanities and interdisciplinary aspects of modern scholarship;
    Computational textual studies, including quantitative stylistics, stylometry, authorship attribution, text mining, etc.;
    Digital arts, architecture, music, film, theatre, new media, digital games, and electronic literature;
    Emerging technologies such as physical computing, single-board computers, minimal computing, wearable devices, and haptic technologies applied to humanities research;
    Digital cultural studies, hacker culture, networked communities, digital divides, digital activism, open/libre networks and software, etc.;
    Digital humanities in pedagogy and academic curricula;
    Critical infrastructure studies, media archaeology, eco-criticism, etc., as they intersect with the digital humanities; and
    Any other theme pertaining to the digital humanities.

The conference will be officially bilingual in Spanish and English, so we invite proposals for presentations particularly in these languages, as well as in the other languages for which we have a sufficient pool of peer reviewers (German, Italian, French, and Portuguese, the latter an important language community of our host region).

Presentations may include:

    Posters (abstract maximum 750 words)
    Short papers (abstract maximum 1 000 words)
    Long papers (abstract maximum 1 500 words)
    Multiple paper panels (500-word abstracts + 500-word overview)
    Pre-conference workshops and tutorials (proposal maximum 1 500 words)

The deadline for submitting poster, short paper, long paper, and multiple-paper panel proposals to the international Program Committee is 11:59pm GMT-6 (local Mexico City time) 27 November 2017. Presenters will be notified of acceptance by March 5 2018.

The deadline for submitting workshops and tutorials, including those proposed by a Special Interest Group (SIG), is 11:59pm GMT-6 (local Mexico City time), 16 February 2018, with notice of acceptance by 16 March, 2018.

When submitting proposals, previous Digital Humanities conference participants and reviewers should use their existing accounts rather than setting up new ones. If you have forgotten your username or password, please contact Program Committee Co-chairs Glen Worthey gworthey [at] stanford [dot] edu or Élika Ortega e.ortegaguzman [at] northeastern [dot] edu.

To facilitate the production of the conference proceedings, authors of accepted papers will be asked to submit final approved versions of their abstracts via the DHConvalidator, available through ConfTool, which creates a TEI text base of conference abstracts for further processing.

Presenters are encouraged to familiarize themselves with Global Outlook::Digital Humanities’ Translation Toolkit to prepare for a bilingual conference. This includes guidelines and best practices for multilingual slides/posters/handouts and ad hoc community translation:  http://go-dh.github.io/translation-toolkit/conferences/

Similarly, participants are strongly encouraged to make themselves aware of current recommendations for accessibility of presentations and multimedia-based materials. Please review the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Initiative Guidelines on Presentation Accessibility: https://www.w3.org/WAI/training/accessible
II: TYPES OF PROPOSALS

Proposals may be of five types: (1) poster presentations; (2) short paper presentations; (3) long papers; (4) multiple-paper panels; (5) pre-conference workshops and tutorials. Short paper and poster proposals are especially welcome and, based on peer review and its mandate to create a balanced and varied program, the Program Committee may offer acceptance in a different category from the one initially proposed. The committee will not normally accept more than a total of two submissions from one primary or co-author. Papers and posters may be given in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, or Portuguese.

All proposals should include relevant citations to sources in the appropriate literature. Citations are not to be included in the word count. Additionally, proposals that concentrate on a particular tool or digital resource should cite traditional as well as computer-based approaches to the problem.

Poster Presentations

Poster proposals (abstract maximum: 750 words) may present work on any relevant topic, or offer project tool, and software demonstrations in any stage of development. Poster presentations are intended to be interactive with the opportunity to exchange ideas one-on-one with attendees.  Posters are in no way considered lesser forms of presentation at the DH conference, are subject to the same strict peer review as other presentation types, and submissions in this category are strongly encouraged.
Short Papers

Short paper proposals (abstract maximum: 1000 words) are intended to be dynamic 10 minute presentations appropriate for reporting on experiments or works in progress or for describing tools or software in development. Short paper sessions seek to open dialogues among scholars working on related topics.  Short papers are in no way considered lesser forms of presentation at the DH conference, are subject to the same strict peer review as other presentation types, and submissions in this category are strongly encouraged.

Long Papers

Proposals for long papers (abstract maximum: 1500 words) should deal with substantial or completed research; report the development of significant new methodologies or digital resources; and present rigorous theoretical, speculative, or critical discussions. Individual papers will be allocated 20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes for questions.

Proposals relating to the development of new computing methodologies or digital resources should indicate how the methods are applied to research and/or teaching in the humanities and what their impact has been in formulating and addressing research questions. They should also include critical assessments of their application in the humanities as well as of the computing methodologies used.

Multiple Paper Panels

Panels (abstract maximum: 500 words for overview, plus 500 words for each paper) should focus on a single theme and be conceived as 90-minute sessions of four to six speakers.

Since the conference offers an important occasion to attract new scholars from diverse backgrounds to specific research areas, those submitting proposals for panels are advised to ensure that the constitution of the panel reflects the constitution of the field and/or research topic that is being addressed and ADHO’s expressed commitment to diversity, or explicitly address problems in those areas. In case the proposer’s own network is too limited, the Program Committee can advise them on whom to contact to broaden the panel. Please contact the PC chairs Glen Worthey gworthey [at] stanford [dot] edu or Élika Ortega e.ortegaguzman [at] northeastern [dot] edu if you need advice.
Pre-Conference Workshops and Tutorials

Tutorials are normally half-day intensive introductions to specific techniques, software packages or theoretical approaches with a small number of participants. Workshop proposals may take many forms, including proposals with a full slate of speakers and presentations, as well as proposals to issue an independent call for papers from which submissions will be chosen. Participants in pre-conference workshops and tutorials will be expected to register for the full conference as well as pay a small additional fee.

Proposals should provide the following information:

    Title and brief description of the content or topic and its relevance to the digital humanities community (not more than 1500 words);
    Full contact information for all tutorial instructors or workshop leaders, including a one-paragraph statement summarizing their research interests and areas of expertise;
    Description of target audience and expected number of participants (based, if possible, on past experience); and
    Special requirements for technical support.

Additionally, tutorial proposals should include:

    A brief outline showing that the core content can be covered in a half-day (approximately 3 hours, plus breaks). In exceptional cases, full-day tutorials may be supported.

And workshop proposals must include:

    Intended length and format of the workshop (minimum half-day; maximum one-and-a-half days);
    Proposed budget (as workshops are expected to be self-financing); and
    If the workshop is to have its own call for participation, a deadline and date for notification of acceptances, and a list of individuals who have agreed to be part of the workshop’s Program Committee.

As with Multi Paper Panel proposals, those submitting proposals for pre-conference workshops and tutorials are advised to ensure that the constitution of the workshop reflects the constitution of the field and/or research topic that is being addressed and ADHO’s expressed commitment to diversity, or explicitly address problems in those areas.  In case the proposer’s own network is too limited, the Program Committee can advise them on whom to contact to broaden the panel. Please contact the PC chairs Glen Worthey gworthey [at] stanford [dot] edu or Élika Ortega e.ortegaguzman [at] northeastern [dot] edu if you need advice.
Workshops endorsed by an ADHO Special Interest Group (SIG):

Workshops endorsed by a SIG and focused on a topic related to the concerned SIG are required to follow the same instructions as other workshops and will be subject to peer review, but will be given special consideration by the Program Committee.   
III: ADHO CONFERENCE CODE OF CONDUCT

The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) is dedicated to creating a safe, respectful, and collegial conference environment for the benefit of everyone who attends and for the advancement of research and scholarship in fields supported by our constituent organizations. The ADHO Digital Humanities conference Code of Conduct is available at http://adho.org/administration/conference-coordinating-program-committee/adho-conference-code-conduct. All people submitting proposals to DH2018 should observe and uphold it.
IV: VENUE AND THEME

DH2018 will take place at the Maria Isabel Sheraton Hotel in downtown Mexico City, Mexico, and is hosted jointly by El Colegio de México (COLMEX), Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), and Red de Humanidades Digitales (RedHD). The local organizers are Isabel Galina, Ernesto Priani, Alberto Santiago Martínez, and Micaela Chávez Villa. This is the first time that the annual conference will be officially bilingual in Spanish and English, which aligns with the efforts at DH2017, the first English and French bilingual conference, and will benefit accessibility for local scholars and attendees. The theme of “Bridges/Puentes” underscores the conference’s commitment to making our organization more global and diverse.
V: BURSARIES FOR EARLY-CAREER AND EMERGING SCHOLARS

The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations will offer a limited number of bursaries for early-career scholars presenting at the conference. Application guidelines will appear on the ADHO website later this year: http://www.adho.org.
VI: International Travel Accommodation

For DH 2018 the Program Committee will open a special asynchronous track for accepted presentations by participants unable to travel to Mexico City. Proposals should be submitted using the same instructions as all other proposals; arrangements for video presentations in the asynchronous track will be made closer to the conference dates for participants affected by any kind of travel limitation. Presenters in this track will be asked to produce a video of their accepted presentation of no more than 10 minutes in length, and will upload it to a designated channel where it will be published by the conference.
